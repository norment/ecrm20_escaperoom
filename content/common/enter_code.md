_So you think you've collected all the letters, you should have 14 of them by now. These letters together form a word, or a name rather_

_The name refers to a well-known Nature journal that recently increased its APC. The next clue is the new APC in 2021 in US dollars of this journal. You may use Google to find the APCs_

_Here's how you unlock the key:_
-   _Open a new tab in your browser_
-   _Write this text on a piece of paper: `norment.github.io/ecrm20_escape_room/items/`_
-   _Append the four digits of the APC to this text (like `norment.github.io/ecrm20_escape_room/items/<####>`)_
-   _Type this url in an empty tab in your browser, and go have a look what you find there!_
