### Dr. Springer: 

![](/images/villain-standing.png)

_Ah, you found me again! What do you want?_

_Okay, if you're here for the next clue, I'm going to need you to get some sympathy for me. My great-granduncle, Julius Springer, founded a publishing company in 1842 in Germany. In 2015, it merged with Nature Publishing Group to form a successful company called "Springer-Nature" that publishes a large portion of the scientific literature you read. We facilitate the scientific process you rely on! We are very important and so we're allowed to make a little bit of money. For instance, in 2019 Springer-Nature had a revenuw of **only** $1.72 billion! Look at our biggest rival, Elsevier Publishing Group, an evil Dutch empire. In 2019, their revenue was about double that at $3.4 billion, more than all Norwegian telecom companies, including `ICE`, and comparable to the yearly revenue for Twitter in 2019, ! In 2011 Elsevier publicly supported a bill in the US Congress that would have made any Open Access policy at publicly funded institutions illegal. In order to continue, why don't you Google around a bit and find out what the name of that bill is?_
