      <description>Robin So you think you&amp;rsquo;ve collected all the letters, you should have 14 of them by now. These letters together form a word, or a name rather
The name refers to a well-known Nature journal that recently increased its APC. The next clue is the new APC in 2021 in US dollars of this journal. You may use Google to find the APCs

      <title>Springer-Nature vs Elsevier</title>

      <description>Dr. Springer: Ah, you found me again! What do you want?
Okay, if you&amp;rsquo;re here for the next clue, I&amp;rsquo;m going to need you to get some sympathy for me. My great-granduncle, Julius Springer, founded a publishing company in 1842 in Germany. In 2015, it merged with Nature Publishing Group to form a successful company called &amp;ldquo;Springer-Nature&amp;rdquo; that publishes a large portion of the scientific literature you read. We facilitate the scientific process you rely on!</description>

      <title>The Impact of Preprints</title>

      <description>Robin So I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve managed to calculate the median number of download for these journals and get the impact factor!
If you visualized the data, you might have seen something like the plot below. There is a really strong relationship between number of downloads of a preprint and the impact factor of the journal. Now, this may be a bit of a chicken-and-egg story. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether articles eventually published in a high-impact journal will get more downloads on their preprint, or whether preprints who have been very popular before being published are more likely to be published in a high-impact journal?</description>
