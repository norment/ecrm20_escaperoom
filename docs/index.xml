      <description>Robin: So you think you&amp;rsquo;ve collected all the letters, you should have 14 of them by now. These letters together form a word, or a name rather
The name refers to a Nature journal that recently increased its APC. The next clue is the new APC in 2021 in US dollars of this journal. You may use Google to find the APCs

      <title>What is Gold Open Access?</title>

      <description>Making something Open Access via the Gold route means to publish in a way that allows immediate access to all readers free of charge. This is done by publishing in Open Access Journals, where authors often pay an APC (Article Processing Charge) to publish. The MONEY for the APC usually comes from the funder or institution (if the institution has an Open Access fund), so authors very rarely pay this charge out of their own pocket.</description>

      <description>Making something Open Access (freely available with no costs for the reader or the author) via the Green route means to publish in a subscription journal, but making the AAM (Author Accepted Manuscript) available for free in an institutional or subject specific repository. This is called self-archiving. The AAM is the last version of the manuscript (after peer review) that has been accepted for publication, but has not had journal formatting.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Preprints</title>

      <description>Robin: So I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve managed to calculate the median number of download for these journals and get the impact factor!
If you visualized the data, you might have seen something like the plot below. There is a really strong relationship between number of downloads of a preprint and the impact factor of the journal. Now, this may be a bit of a chicken-and-egg story. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether articles eventually published in a high-impact journal will get more downloads on their preprint, or whether preprints who have been very popular before being published are more likely to be published in a high-impact journal?</description>

      <description>Dr. Springer: Ah, you found me again! What do you want?
Okay, if you&amp;rsquo;re here for the next clue, I&amp;rsquo;m going to need you to get some sympathy for me. My great-granduncle, Julius Springer, founded a publishing company in 1842 in Germany. In 2015, it merged with Nature Publishing Group to form a successful company called &amp;ldquo;Springer-Nature&amp;rdquo; that publishes a large portion of the scientific literature you read. We facilitate the scientific process you rely on!</description>

      <description>The idea of this Open Science Escape Room came from Katrine Sundsbø at the University of Essex1. Their version of the Open Access Escape Room was launched at the Open Access Week in 2018. The original idea took place in an actual physical space, in this case the university library. While this might have been possible in &amp;ldquo;The Before Times&amp;rdquo;, COVID has inspired us to adapt the idea into an online version so participants can engage from the comfort of their couch.</description>

      <description>Robin We did it! You found the exit! Remember the following line, it&amp;rsquo;s proof that you actually found the key:
 &amp;ldquo;A closed door is seldomly an invitation&amp;rdquo;
 Now you can go and make yourself a cup of coffee until we move on with the rest of the program, or you can explore the escape room to see if you can find any of the easter eggs

      <description>Welcome to the Open Access Escape Room. An escape room is a physical adventure game where you will attempt to solve a series of puzzles and riddles using clues, hints and strategy to &amp;ldquo;escape&amp;rdquo; the room.
In our version we will not lock the room, but the game will finish when you complete the last task in the last item you unlock. The game will be linear, meaning once you&amp;rsquo;ve completed one puzzle and unlocked an item you will get a clue to the next puzzle.</description>

      <description>Robin: Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Robin!
I&amp;rsquo;ll be your host in this game. In the year 2060 all research will be published with no costs for readers or authors. This is called Diamond Open Access. In 2020 it is a bit different, and making research available for free can be… well, expensive or time consuming. You’re probably wondering why I’ve invited you here. As supporters of Open Access, I need your help. The villain, Dr.</description>

      <description>Det er den draumen me ber på
at noko vedunderleg skal skje,
at det må skje –
at tidi skal opna seg,
at hjarta skal opna seg,
at dører skal opna seg,
at berget skal opna seg,
at kjeldor skal springa –
at draumen skal opna seg,
at me ei morgonstund skal glida inn
på ein våg me ikkje har visst um.
&amp;ndash; Olav H. Hauge (1966)

      <description>Robin: One of the superstars fighting against the monopoly of the large publishers, and literally breaking down pay-walls is the developer of the website SciHub.
In order to unlock the door and &amp;ldquo;escape&amp;rdquo; the room, you need to collect three colors
 The flag of the country where the founder of SciHub originated from has the colors blue and … What is the color of the key in the SciHub logo?</description>

Dr. Springer: What is it? Can’t you see I am busy? Okay, let’s play a game.
Pick a number between 1 and 5&amp;hellip;
Do you have one?
Now pick another number between 20 and 60&amp;hellip;
Okay, now multiply those two.

      <description>Teachers, practicioners and anyone else without access to research through an institution can access and use research to improve their work Academics in developing countries can access research and stay up to date in their fields Public Access: Taxpayers feel they get value for their money Increased visibility of research More citations (due to more visibility) Compliant with funders (and the Research Excellence Framework) More transparency so academics can replicate and validate previous research When data is shared openly it can be used in other studies; reducing time and effort More accurate reporting from journalists to the public Open Access publications can help inform policy  ❥ ▲ ◘</description>
