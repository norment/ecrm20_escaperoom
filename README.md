# Virtual Open Science Escape Room

Everything needed to host the virtual Open Science Escape Room, based on a concept by Kristine SundsbÃ¸. It starts with two separate paths that converge after just a few steps. Escape Room refers to places outside of the Escape Room twice. Look at the files to see where and where to adapt if necessary.

This version was created for the NORMENT Early-Career Researchers Meeting 2020. There are some NORMENT links and design elements througout the website.

We recommend to "close" the Escape Room before the event to avoid peeking. One can either make the repository private (if that option is available). The website can also be closed from the user-end by replacing the menu items with a link to the `closed.md` file in the `items` folder. Everything else on the website remains available for testing if you know the links to access the other pages in the Escape Room.

The Escape Room is build as a simple Hugo website using the "Sam" theme designed by [Victoria Drake](https://github.com/victoriadrake) and adapted and modified by [Daniel Roelfs](https://github.com/danielroelfs). This virtual escape room is based on a physical version by [Katrine SundsbÃ¸](https://twitter.com/katrinesundsbo)

The website for the Escape Room can be hosted on GitHub pages and Netlify.

Enjoy! ðŸ‘‹
